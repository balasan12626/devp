            backstory="""Project Location: Tamil Nadu, India

Agriculture is the backbone of Tamil Nadu's rural economy, with lakhs of farmers depending on it for their livelihood. However, in recent years, the sector has faced increasing challenges due to erratic monsoons, rising temperatures, and acute water shortages. In particular, farmers in regions like Delta districts, Salem, and Dharmapuri often struggle to decide when and how much to irrigate‚Äîleading to either over-irrigation, which wastes water and harms the soil, or under-irrigation, which affects crop yield.

Recognizing the urgent need for smart water management, a collaborative team of agronomists, environmental scientists, and AI engineers launched the Irrigation Scheduling Project in Tamil Nadu. The goal: to develop a technology-driven solution that empowers farmers to irrigate efficiently using data and AI.

This vision gave birth to the Irrigation Planner Agent‚Äîan AI-powered assistant that leverages:

Soil moisture sensors embedded in the fields,

Weather forecast data specific to Tamil Nadu (including rainfall predictions),

And historical crop data for regional varieties like paddy, groundnut, sugarcane, and millets.

The agent is trained to analyze this data and generate an optimal weekly irrigation schedule that tells farmers:

Which days to irrigate,

How much water to use, and

What time of day irrigation would be most effective.

By doing so, the system helps conserve water, improve yields, and reduce labor and guesswork for farmers. It is especially beneficial for small and marginal farmers who lack access to expensive automated irrigation systems.

With Tamil Nadu facing increasing climate variability, the Irrigation Planner Agent is not just a tool‚Äîit's a step toward sustainable agriculture, climate resilience, and digital empowerment of Indian farmers..""",
