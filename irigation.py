üß† Backstory (AI-generated)
In the quiet village of Thendralpuram, nestled between dry plains and green hills, farmers once struggled to grow crops due to unpredictable weather. Some years brought harsh sun and cracked earth. Other times, rains flooded the fields.

In 2023, a group of young engineers installed a Smart Irrigation Plant in the heart of the village. It was connected to weather sensors and powered by AI. The system was trained to understand seasonal patterns and decide when to irrigate crops.

üåû Summer Months (March to May)
In March, the temperature began to rise. April brought heat waves touching 38¬∞C. The system reduced daytime watering and switched to early mornings and late evenings to prevent water evaporation.

üåßÔ∏è Monsoon Months (June to September)
By June, clouds gathered. The system detected increased humidity and paused watering during heavy rains. In July and August, rainfall peaked. The system diverted excess water to underground tanks to reuse during dry spells.

üçÇ Post-Monsoon (October, November)
October was cloudy but dry. November brought light showers. The irrigation plant adjusted to shorter watering intervals. AI predicted fungal risks in crops due to moisture, so it warned farmers to switch fertilizers.

‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter (December to February)
Cold winds swept through December. Watering was scheduled at mid-day when temperatures were warmest (around 21¬∞C). The system prevented frost damage by keeping soil temperature stable using covered drip lines.

By the end of the year, crop yield increased by 40%, and water usage dropped by 55%.
